        <h3>
            CS:GO is a widely popular first-shooter game where two team "terrorists" and "counter-terrorists" 
            competes against each other with the task either to plant the bomb and explode it from the terrorists 
            side or defuse the bomb from the counter-terrorists side. Both teams can also win a round by killing the 
            whole enemy squad. There are 9 game modes, but the most popular mode is mr16(max-rounds) mode,
            where the team which first
            wins 16 rounds, wins the game. If both teams make 15 winning rounds, then it goes for overtime where enemies
            play a total of 3 rounds on both sides, and the team which achieve more rounds in total of 6, wins the game.
            Both teams and players have to pay attention to the economical part. Every winning round gives an amount of
            dollars based on if your team won or lost a round and how many enemies did one player kill. The player who 
            killed the most enemies, gets more money for the next round, so he can get more money to use to buy weapons 
            and other devices 
            on the next round. The losing team achieve less money, but if a team consistanly keeps losing round by round, 
            the game
            gives them a chance with more money after every round they lose until they finaly win a round and the 
            economic system 
            restarts. That was invented for not so long time ago so the cs:go scene became a little more competative
            and not too one-sided for the best cs:go teams in the world. 
            <br><br>
            Beside that, cs:go is a really big thing in 
            2020. There are being 
            arranged a lot of tournaments world wide with the prize money up to 1 000 000 dollars for a winning team. 
            Its a huge industry
            that consists of a lot of teams, sponsors, companies and the players which plays on a professional teams
            gets sallary which is quite higher than the sallary of an average worker in Norway. Players from top 10 
            teams in the world can
            f.ex. earn between 20 000 to 100 000 dollars each month from the organizations the play for and sponsors 
            that pay them for making a commercial. If you want to find out more about counter-strike, click on the link below.  </h3>
